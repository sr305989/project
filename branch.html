    <h1>BRANCH</h1><br>
    <p><strong>Structural support</strong><br>
Branches support the tree's leaves, fruits, and flowers. They also help the tree spread its leaves to gather sunlight for photosynthesis.<br>
<strong>Transportation</strong><br>
Branches transport water from the soil to the leaves and food from the leaves to the rest of the tree.<br>
<strong>Reproduction</strong><br>
Branches spread out the tree's reproductive structures, like flowers and fruits, increasing the likelihood of successful pollination and seed dispersal.<br>
<strong>Habitat</strong><br>
Branches provide habitats for various animals, including birds, insects, and mammals.<br>
<strong>Tree branches can also be used for:</strong><br>
